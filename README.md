Analysis to better understand LT's loan portfolio by segmenting customers by their credit score and the range of interest rates they pay. 

I want to see if there are any efficiencies to be achieved in allocating credit to borrowers. The original dataset doesn't distinguish borrowers very much beyond debt-to-income and other standard metrics.

This project was done with Python via the Jupyter platform; the dataset was obtained from the good folks at Kaggle.
